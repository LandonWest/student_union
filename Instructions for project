-Create new rails application called student_union.
-Generate a Student model name and course attributes
-Create and migrate your database
-Generate a Students controller with index, show, new and create actions.
-In your students views folder, create show, new , and index views
-Edit your routes file so that your student views are accessible. (Resources)
-Edit your views:
    -The index view should list all the Students with their name and course. The index
     view should also have a link to your new view, and each student should have a link
     to their show view.

    -The new view should have a form for creating a new student.

    -The show view should show the selected student with their name and course.
-Set the root of you site to be the students/index page.
-In your model, validate the presence of the name and course attributes.
-Update your controller with the edit, update, and destroy actions. You'll need to look this
 up, as we haven't covered it, but it's pretty straight forward.
